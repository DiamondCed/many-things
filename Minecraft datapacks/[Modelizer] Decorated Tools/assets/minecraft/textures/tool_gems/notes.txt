trident doesn't work due to... some problem with how the game works I guess
1_3 version added amethyst, removed quartz(?)
1_4 version fixed redstone/lapis and added amber
1_5 version added crossbow compatibility

crossbow: 
- standby, pulling_0 share sprite 0
- pulling_1, pulling_2 each have their own sprite (1, 2)
- loaded_arrow, loaded_firework share sprite 3
