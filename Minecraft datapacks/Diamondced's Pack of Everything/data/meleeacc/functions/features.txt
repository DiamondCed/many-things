- Feral claws: +melee speed (aka attack speed) when equipped 	-> Jungle temple chests (cmd 38)
Debuff accessories:
- Venomous Gland: Gives melee strikes poison effect		-> Cave spiders (cmd 39)
- Withering Petals: Gives melee strikes wither effect		-> Wither (not 100% drop, maybe 50% or 33%) (cmd 40)
- Frost Stone: Gives melee strikes slowness effect		-> Strays (cmd 41)
- Weakening Grasp: Gives melee strikes weakness effect		-> Husks (cmd 42)
- Shulker Eye: Gives melee strikes levitation effect		-> Shulkers (cmd 43)
All of which can be combined with feral claws to make the following:
- Venomous Claws: Melee speed, Knockback and Poison		-> Crafting (cmd 44)
- Withering Claws: Melee speed, Knockback and Wither		-> Crafting (cmd 45)
- Forst Claws: Melee speed, Knockback and Slowness		-> Crafting (cmd 46)
- Weakening Claws: Melee speed, Knockback and Weakness		-> Crafting (cmd 47)
- Shulker Claws: Melee speed, Knockback and Levitation		-> Crafting (cmd 48)

// old plans
- Titan glove: Increased attack knockback when equipped -> This doesn't work!!
- Power glove: Combines feral claws and titan glove

All of which can be combined with Power Glove to make:
- Venomous Gauntlet: Melee speed, Knockback and Poison
- Withering Gauntlet: Melee speed, Knockback and Wither
- Webbed Gauntlet: Melee speed, Knockback and Slowness
- Weakening Gauntlet: Melee speed, Knockback and Weakness
- Blinding Gauntlet: Melee speed, Knockback and Blindness
- Shulker Gauntlet: Melee speed, Knockback and Levitation
These do not stack their melee speed or knockback, but I'll allow the debuffs to stack
Having two sources of the same debuff does not stack however, too op (and inconvenient to code :P)
