What is this?
This is just a quick tool to replace the background on cards. It will remove whatever is indicated in the template files and composite in the wanted images instead. If the image is shorter than the card, it will be mirrored vertically. 

To use: 
- create a folder (like the example DECK 1 here)
- within, place folders named "Cards" and "Images"
- put your base cards and images in the respective folders. Names do not matter, just make sure they show up in the same alphanumerical order
- copy/move the script into the parent folder (eg. DECK 1), and run it

Changing templates:
If you have a different card type in mind (the default ones are for MtG I believe), you can try looking at the .psd file for some insight into creating the templates. Unfortunately, you will need two templates for the script to run (unless you tweak it), but you can just make it two copies of the same template.

** The templates have to be the same size as the cards, otherwise I expect PIL to throw an error **
