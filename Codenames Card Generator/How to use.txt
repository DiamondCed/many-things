Word Cards:
Make a list of words to place on cards in something like excel -> In the first column -> Save as .csv; Make sure there's an even amount of them
If you want a different font: in the make_word_cards script, change the font name used in the "for page in range(num_pages)" block (Line 99)
Drag and drop the .csv onto the script OR run the script in terminal with the .csv as argument -> Will create/replace word_cards.pdf
Print the pdf in "Print on both sides - Flip on short edge" mode

Advice: print only the first 2 or 4 pages as an alignment test - you may need to change "EXTRA_BORDER_LEFT" on line 17 to line up the front and back of the card better

Guess Cards: 
Replace the images in guess_cards with the ones you want; make sure to keep the names identical, and in the .png format: 
blue1, blue2, red1, red2, white1, white2, black, doubleblue, doublered
Then simply run make_guess_cards and the guess_cards.pdf will contain the cards to print

Key Cards: This is not strictly necessary if you already own a version of codenames; this is just to make standard sized cards to match the rest of this set
You can go change the design on the back of the cards in the script (function at line 79), simplest changes are to just change the text and font.
Running make_key_cards will create key_cards.pdf for you to print.
