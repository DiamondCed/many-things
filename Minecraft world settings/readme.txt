(Designed for 1.18.2, should work up to 1.19.3)
All world settings files come with a hard-coded seed in various places;
To get a new seed for a given file, run randomize_seed.py with the desired settings file as argument (you can drag-n-drop it)
-> It will output [filename]_reseeded.json; You can then use this file in the Import Settings button.

Descriptions:
skylands_fractured: originally an attempt at proper skylands, feels more like a shattered world
skylands_extreme: what happens when skylands just... don't stop vertically
skylands_neo: the overworld, but shaped like the end! start out on a skyblock-like central island, and traverse the void to reach the outer lands
skylands_neo_proxima: like skylands_neo, but without the central island; the outer reaches cover the center too
