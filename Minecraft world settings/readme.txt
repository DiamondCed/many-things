(Designed for 1.18.2, should work up to 1.19.3)
All world settings files come with a hard-coded seed in various places;
To get a new seed for a given file, run randomize_seed.py with the desired settings file as argument (you can drag-n-drop it)
-> It will output [filename]_reseeded.json; You can then use this file in the Import Settings button.
