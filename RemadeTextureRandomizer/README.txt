Mildly outdated - should work fine for 1.18.2 however
may be updated eventually to include more varied assets and better converted textures if I bother

To use: open Gui_Window.pyw; the other .py files are used by the ui to generate the packs
The output will be resources.zip; it can then be used as server resources/world resources, or just as a normal resource pack.
Alternatively, you can use the uncompressed randomized_pack folder as a normal resource pack too.

randomized_datapack is currently a vestigial part of the program, as it doesn't use the datapack part anymore. Again, if I end up updating this, it might become relevant.
